# Data from the Web, Combining Data


## Part 1 - Combine Sp21 Course Info with Requirements

-Worked on parsing html with a library and regular expressions to extract course information data. Additionally, used the merge function to put together data from two different DataFrames based on key.

1. Read the 2021 course schedule into a DataFrame

2. Read the 2021 course catalog into a DataFrame

3. Put together both DataFrames

4. Conclusion

## Part 2 - Using an API

-Requested data from a server in json format, parse it, and load it into a DataFrame. Using this DataFrame used aggregations to produce a report.

-The goal of the assignment is to create a report showing director's names, the number of Ghibli films that the directors was involved in, and the average rotten tomatoes score of the Studio Ghibli films made by that director.
